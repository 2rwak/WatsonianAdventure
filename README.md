Detecting Contradiction and Entailment in Multilingual Text using TPUs

This is a project for the course SWE485: Selected Topics in Software Engineering, developed by Arwa, Reef, and Sadeem.

### Project Motivation
In this project, we aim to develop a machine learning model that can detect contradiction and entailment in multilingual text. This is an important problem in natural language processing that has applications in areas such as information retrieval, question answering, and text summarization.

### Dataset
We have chosen the "[Contradictory, My Dear Watson](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/contradictory-my-dear-watson/data?select=train.csv)" dataset, which contains pairs of text from various sources in different languages, along with a label indicating whether the two texts are contradictory, entailment, or neutral. The dataset was collected for the task of natural language inference and is available on the Kaggle website.

### Data Preparation
In order to prepare the dataset for use in machine learning models, we will apply various preprocessing techniques, such as tokenization, stemming, and feature engineering. We will also explore the data using visualization tools to gain insights into its distribution and characteristics.

We will include a Jupyter notebook in this repository that describes our data preparation process, including our justification for each preprocessing technique.

### Folder Structure
Dataset: contains the "Contradictory, My Dear Watson" dataset.
notebooks: contains the Jupyter notebook describing our data preparation process.
